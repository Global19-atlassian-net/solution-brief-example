## Overview

Docker Solution Briefs enable you to integrate the Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) container platform with popular 3rd party ecosystem solutions for networking, load balancing, storage, logging and monitoring, access management, and more.

Add a description of your solution brief here. You should include a short blurb of your product and how it integrates with Docker.

## Prerequisites

List the assets that your users need to successfully complete the tasks in your solution brief. Include links to related Docker Solution Briefs or install guides to describe the beginning state of the users environment that you require to complete your instructions.

As an example (edit this to fit your requirements):

- [Docker EE 17.06 Platform on VMware vSphere](https://success.docker.com/article/certified-infrastructures-vmware-vsphere)
- VSphere 6.0

## Installation and Configuration

Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for your Solution Brief here. If there is automation involved, then start with the inclusion of your automation code into a Docker EE deployment, and then how to make sure the automation run starts correctly.

1. First step:
    Include shell and/or code snippets for each step

    ```
    % docker info
    ```
2. Second step:
    Also include example output as needed:
    ```
    Containers: 0
    Running: 0
    Paused: 0
    Stopped: 0
    Images: 0
    Server Version: 17.12.0-ce
    ...

    Experimental: true
    Insecure Registries:
     127.0.0.0/8
    Live Restore Enabled: false
    ```
